# RL-Pong

This prject is a part of Reinforcement learning course at Aalto University. The wimblepong environment is created by course staffs.https://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/wimblepong
In this project, we implemented a reinforcement learning agent to play against a hardcoded-AI agent in a pong game. 
Our agent uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to update its policy.The policy is represented by convolution neural network
